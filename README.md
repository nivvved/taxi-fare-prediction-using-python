**Taxi Fare Prediction**

This project aims to predict taxi fares using machine learning techniques.

**Data:**
* **Source:** [Specify data source, e.g., Kaggle, Uber Movement]
* **Cleaning:** Data is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features like distance, time, and passenger count are extracted.

**Model:**
* **Algorithm:** [Specify algorithm, e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost]
* **Training:** Model is trained on the cleaned and preprocessed data.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimal hyperparameters are tuned to improve model performance.

**Evaluation:**
* **Metrics:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and MAE.
* **Visualization:** Visualizations are used to understand model performance and feature importance.

**Deployment:**
* **API:** The model can be deployed as an API for real-time predictions.
* **Web Application:** A web application can be built to provide fare estimates to users.

**Future Work:**
* **Incorporate Real-time Data:** Utilize real-time traffic and weather data to improve predictions.
* **Explore Advanced Techniques:** Experiment with deep learning and time series analysis.
* **Consider Ethical Implications:** Ensure fair and unbiased predictions, especially in pricing algorithms.
